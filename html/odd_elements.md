# HTML Elements: hr, br, sup, and sub

## hr (Horizontal Rule)

- Purpose: Creates a horizontal line to visually separate content.
- Example:

```html
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

This would result in a horizontal line between the two paragraphs.

## br (Line Break)

- Purpose: Inserts a line break within a block-level element (like <p>, <div>, etc.).
- Example:

```html
<p>This is a long sentence<br>
with a line break.</p>
```

This would create a line break within the paragraph, making it appear on two lines.

## sup (Superscript)

- Purpose: Renders text as superscript (smaller and raised above the baseline).
- Example:

```html
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O is the chemical formula for water.</p>
```

This would display "H" and "O" as subscripts, and "2" as a superscript.

# sub (Subscript)

- Purpose: Renders text as subscript (smaller and lowered below the baseline).
- Example:
```html
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is the chemical formula for carbon dioxide.</p>
```

This would display "CO" as normal text, and "2" as a subscript.
